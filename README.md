# Descriptive Statistics with Python
This project involves descriptive statistical analysis of a dataset containing environmental measurements. The data includes temperature, humidity, light, CO2 levels, and humidity ratio, along with occupancy status.

## Data Description
### The dataset includes the following columns:

1. date: Timestamp of the measurement.
2. Temperature: Temperature in Celsius.
3. Humidity: Humidity percentage.
4. Light: Light level.
5. CO2: CO2 concentration in ppm.
6. HumidityRatio: Humidity ratio.
7. Occupancy: Occupancy status (1 if occupied, 0 if not).
## Goals
+ Calculate descriptive statistics for the dataset.
+ Present box plots of the dependent variables.
+ Interpret the results.
## Descriptive Statistics
### Descriptive statistics involve calculating the following measures for each variable:

* Arithmetic Mean
* Median
* Mode
* First and Third Quartiles (Q1 and Q3)
* Variance
* Standard Deviation
* Coefficient of Variation
* Range
* Skewness
* Kurtosis
## Implementation in Python
  The entire analysis will be implemented in Python using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy.stats libraries.

## Interpretation
+ Arithmetic Mean: The average value of the data.
+ Median: The middle value when the data is ordered.
+ Mode: The most frequently occurring value.
+ First and Third Quartiles (Q1 and Q3): Values that divide the data into four equal parts.
Variance: Measure of the dispersion of the data points.
+ Standard Deviation: Square root of the variance.
+ Coefficient of Variation: Standard deviation divided by the mean.
+ Range: Difference between the maximum and minimum values.
+ Skewness: Measure of the asymmetry of the data distribution.
+ Kurtosis: Measure of the "tailedness" of the data distribution.
### This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the data's distribution and variability, helping to identify patterns and insights.
